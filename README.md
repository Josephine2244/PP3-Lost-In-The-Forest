## User Stories

- As a new user, I would like to be able to start the game easily.
- As a new user, I would like the controls of the game to be easy to understand and follow.
- As a new user, I would like to have multiple paths to take so the game is varied.

## Features

# Title
The title is displayed in a big font at the begninning of the game to draw the attention of the user.

# Add Name
The user adds their name at the beginning of the game to personalise the experience.

# Multiple paths with different choices
There are two paths the user can choose from. Each come with their own challenges and choices along the way.

## Future Features
- Multiple difficulty levels
- A choice of game locations

## Typography and Color Scheme
- A large font is used to display the title at the beginning of the game to capture the users attention.
- Where users must input a choice to move forward, the options are presented in a green font so that they stand out to the user.
- A blue font is used to display the riddle so that it is clear to the user that it is separate from the story narration of the game.
